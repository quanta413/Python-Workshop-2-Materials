    "\n",
    "In today's workshop, we'll be covering coding in a text editor, the <code>if</code> statement, and the most common ways to combine different pieces of data in Python: tuples, lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will often want to reuse code you write to do an analysis or to collect data. Jupyter notebooks are good for exploration and presentation, but it can be hard to reuse code from a jupyter notebook or to write larger pieces of code in it. So we're going to execute code and do the exercises today in the text editor Spyder, and only use jupyter notebooks to present information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful construct we didn't talk about last workshop is the <code>if</code> statement. The if statement lets you instruct Python to execute one piece of code if a condition is true and a different piece of code if the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming, you'll often find you have a collection of related items like a collection of numbers describing the position of a particle over time or a collection of words making up a sentence. Because this occurs a lot, Python comes with data structures for very general but useful ways you might want to aggregate data. The most common ones are Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries. We'll cover the basics of all three.\n",

Sometimes you can do something with more than one type of data structure, but the different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses. We'll start with the simplest data structure and move on to the most complicated.\n",
